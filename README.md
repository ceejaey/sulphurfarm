# SulphurFarm: A Simple Self-Contained Angular Project

SulphurFarm is a simple self-contained Angular project that provides static pages and service-driven data pages powered by a local JSON server. This project serves as a baseline for an angular application exploration and learning, which can be expanded via different branches to explore various CI operations and configurations.

## Introduction

SulphurFarm is an effort aimed at setting out a simple, self-contained Angular project that showcases the basic structure of an Angular application. The purpose of this project is to provide a baseline for angular development, allowing developers to experiment with different configurations and CI operations without being tied to any external dependencies or services.

## Features

SulphurFarm includes the following key features:

- Static HTML pages split into small Angular components and pages.
- Blog system with basic service data fetching.
- Data fetched from static JSON content hosted within the application.

The project is designed to be a starting point for developers looking to create their own Angular applications, providing a flexible foundation that can be expanded in various ways.
